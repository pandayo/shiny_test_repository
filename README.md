# shiny_test_repository

This repository is used to work with [shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/) in order to create an interactive plotting tool for distribution functions used in econometrics.

Still to do:

1. Verteilungen:
  * [x] Binomial
  * [x] Poisson
  * [x] Exponential
  * [x] Normal
  * [x] t
  * [x] Chi-square
  * [x] F
  * [x] Uniform
2. [x] Default range
3. [x] Default smoothing
4. [ ] Maybe multiple functions in one picture
5. [ ] md/text + shiny in one
6. [ ] Help text
7. [x] Dropdown: stuff: line/smooth, points, bars
8. [ ] Hypothesis-tests
