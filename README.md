# shiny_test_repository

This repository is used to work with [shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/) in order to create an interactive plotting tool for distribution functions used in econometrics.

Still to do:

1. Verteilungen:
  * [x] Binomial
  * [ ] Poisson
  * [x] Exponential
  * [x] Normal
  * [ ] t
  * [ ] Chi-square
  * [ ] F
  * [ ] Uniform
2. Default range
3. Default smoothing
4. Maybe multiple functions in one picture
5. md/text + shiny in one
6. Help text
7. Dropdown: stuff: line/smooth, points, bars
8. Hypothesis-tests
